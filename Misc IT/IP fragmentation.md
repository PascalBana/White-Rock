IP fragmentation occurs due to there being a maximum packet size on the network. so what are my questions for today

What is the maximum size for a packet?
how does Fragmentation occur?
Why do they always occur in multiples of 8?
When is fragmentation bad vs good?
does fragmentation cause any problems?

Question 1; What is the maximum size for a packet?
	The maximum size for a packet is measured using an MTU(Maximum Transmission Unit). these are variable sizes
