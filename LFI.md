###### Local File Inclusion 
Any time you see a GET request for any type of file(json,jpeg,txt,png) whatever it might be. Try changing the request to get a different file.
For Instance you could request the `/etc/passwd` file to see if it returns anything.
Click here for more info on the [[passwd]] file

There are plenty of files to request for and most depend on you specific situation.

If more info comes to light on LFI's please note it hear
